To build a website, buy a dot com domain name
from Google.com/domains or goDaddy or NetworkSolutions for example. 
point nameservers at google to your servers ip address / nameservers etc.
For example, angryhosting.com offers an Apache/nginx server for $1 a month. 
You can host as many websites as you want, and don't forget to get the https key.  
Use notepad++ with the macros, regex & multi-cursor for long lists.
 FTP files to your server using an FTP app or program.
 upload index.php or index.html file.
